# CreateShotCutProjectUsingAI

This project, generated with ChatGPT, contains logic to read a list of `.wav` files from disk and add them to a new `.mlt` (Shotcut) project file. The `.wav` files are generated using Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to simplify the video creation process for tutorials related to the Prasso Framework.

## Prerequisites

Before using this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- [TTS](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS)
- Python
- Shotcut

These tools are required to generate `.wav` files, populate the `.mlt` file, and create the training video.

## Usage

1. **Generate the Script**: Use AI tools to generate the script for your video.

2. **Create the .wav Files**:
   - Write a script (`scripts.sh`) to convert the text of your video transcript into `.wav` files using TTS.
   - Run the script to generate the `.wav` files.

3. **Create the .mlt File**:
   - Run the provided Python script to create the `.mlt` file for Shotcut.

4. **Open and Edit in Shotcut**:
   - Open the generated `.mlt` file in Shotcut. The timeline will display each video frame, assuming you used the script to generate a `.wav` file for each frame.
   - Add your video scenes on a new timeline, matching each sceneâ€™s length to the length of the corresponding audio track.

By following these steps, you can streamline the process of creating instructional videos for the Prasso Framework.
